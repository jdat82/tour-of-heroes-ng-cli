# TourOfHeroesNgCli

This project is a plunkr export from some advanced guide in angular.io documentation. 
I have rewritten some parts with ngrx/store and angular-material (covalent) in order to learn them.

A demo is available [here](https://jdat82.github.io/tour-of-heroes-ng-cli).

Unfortunately, due to some limitations with angular 4 in the covalent library, right now I can't deploy in production mode. So this is a dev build.

# Standard behavior of Angular CLI projects

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.0.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
